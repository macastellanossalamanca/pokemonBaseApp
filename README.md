## Pokemon iOS App

- This App displays a list of pokemons, obtained from an API using URLSession.
- Pokemon data is retrieved with pagination, which ensures better performance of the app, still in progress.
- The architechture used in this project is MVVM and Delegate Pattern.
- This project also abstracts Data Manage, therefore we can find a DataManager which fullfills Repository Pattern requirements.
- Its interface is implemented using SwiftUI, which ensures a reactive response.

# How it works

- Just below you can find an image of the project running.
